# Robot Laboratory - Ashlyn McClendon 

This project can be viewed [here](https://ashlyn-mcc.github.io/computational-art-spring2024/assignments/final/). This project can be publically shared.

### Interconnected Aspects 
- The style buttons on the robot building screen are connected to the outputted robot. The users mouse input can alter the color and design of the robot.
- The keys the user presses on the game screen are connected to the arrow objects moving across the screen.
- The input box on the robot screen takes in user input and connects it to a text box allowing the user to display their robot's name.
- This sketch is made up of multiple states. Buttons throughout the game are connected to a currentState variable that controls game flow.
- The platform on the game screen is connected to the users performance. The way the user interacts with the arrows in turn effects the height of the platform the robot is standing on.


Of these effects I think the most interesting one is pressing buttons to alter the robot's design. Having that customization is cool.

### Multimedia 
- I used a gif of moving lava on the game screen.
- I used two different audio tracks in the game: one for building the robot, one for playing the game.
- I used images as button icons on the robot build screen.
